<p>Most of the&nbsp;final products in my cooking and baking ventures&nbsp;are the results of a "choose your own adventure"&nbsp;recipe; mostly because I'm often out of a certain ingredient, or because I substitute&nbsp;my ingredients of choice for those that a recipe calls for. (Often because think I know better than what I've read or heard,&nbsp;which does sometimes happen, but&nbsp;is often not the case.)&nbsp;This recipe is the result of a few&nbsp;different things that I've created in the adventures of&nbsp;raw pies, and pies in general. It's also the product of me playing the "let's just add one more layer/flavor/ingredient" card&nbsp;a few times. This time it all worked out splendidly.&nbsp;<br /><br />A note about the lemons: I really like Meyer lemons...everything about them. I prefer to use all Meyer lemons, but they're usually more expensive than regular lemons, and sometimes harder to find. They also don't pack the sourness of regular lemons, so I concede that they're not perfect when using them in recipes. Therefore, my secret is to use half Meyer lemons, and half regular lemons when baking, so&nbsp;the best qualities of both types of lemons are expressed.&nbsp;<br /><br />This pie&nbsp;is best served cold, so leave time for it to chill for at least a few hours.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Crust:</span></strong><br /><br />1.5 cups almonds, walnuts, or cashews (or a mixture of all of them)<br />1.5 cups dates, pitted&nbsp;<br />2 T shredded coconut<br />Tiny bit of sea salt, some might say a "pinch."</p><p>Blend ingredients in food processor until the nuts are finely chopped and the mixture sticks together. Press into pie plate at your desired thickness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cashew Cream:</strong></p><p>2-3 cups cashews (soaked in water for at least 4 hours, then rinsed and drained)<br />1/2 cup liquid coconut oil<br />2-3 T raw honey or maple syrup (or more or less depending on your desired level of sweetness)<br />1/4 to 1/2 cup lemon juice&nbsp;</p><p>Combine ingredients in food processor. Blend 3-5 minutes, until mixture is creamy and the texture of cashew butter. If it's too thick, add more lemon juice or water. If it's too thin, add more cashews. (You might want to soak more cashews than necessary in case you need to add more to even out the texture.)</p><p><strong>Lemon Curd:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>4 egg yolks<br />1 whole egg&nbsp;<br />1/2 cup butter or coconut oil<br />1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar (I've tried using a&nbsp;liquid sweetener such as honey or maple syrup but the final consistency is more thin. Use less sugar for a more sour flavor.)<br />1/2 cup lemon juice (or the juice of about 4-5 lemons)&nbsp;<br /><br />Using a double boiler on the stovetop, bring water to a boil and add all ingredients, whisking vigorously as to keep the eggs from solidifying. Continue whisking without pause for 5-10 minutes (depending on your water temperature and the geometry of your double boiler setup). Mixture will turn from a creamy liquid to a curd like pudding. Be careful not to overcook, as you can very quickly&nbsp;end up with what I call "lemon eggs," which resemble scrambled eggs. This is not what you want. Remove from heat as soon as you feel it thickening, as it will continue to thicken as it cools. Cool completely before adding it to the pie.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Blueberry Topping:</strong></p><p>2 cups blueberries (or any berry-like fruit)<br />2-3 T chia seeds (white or black, whichever you like)<br /><br />Frozen berries work best as they're already pretty soft. Thaw berries and combine them with chia seeds in a bowl. Using a fork, smash the berries as the chia seeds expand and absorb the moisture. Once combined, set aside 15-20 minutes to fully "gel." The final product should be the consistency and texture of jam, so if it seems&nbsp;too runny, add more chia seeds and wait another 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;If you're using fresh berries, it might be easier to puree them in a food processor first and then mix in the chia seeds.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Layer the pie as you wish. Once the crust was in the pie plate, I added the cashew cream, topped it with lemon curd, and then topped that with the blueberries. The beauty of raw pie is that you can order the layers however you please. I topped this pie with chopped pistachios with the initial intention of&nbsp;decoration,&nbsp;but&nbsp;they do&nbsp;add a nice, earthy flavor to complement the lemon.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy and forgive my approximate measurements! I write&nbsp;recipes from memory, after the fact, and sometimes many days later.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/545bd206e4b06c0dfdfcbe84/545bebc2e4b0b80f3df7fc43/54c6ec07e4b081fa0efaa094/1422326493633/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="960" height="928"><media:title type="plain">Cashew Cream/Lemon Curd/Blueberry Chia Pie</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>The One Thing Every Breastfeeding Mother Should Learn</title><category>Technique</category><dc:creator>Emily Whebbe</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 02:46:57 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.minneapolisbreastfeeding.com/blog/2014/11/23/the-one-thing-every-breastfeeding-mother-should-learn</link><guid isPermaLink="false">545bd206e4b06c0dfdfcbe84:545bebc2e4b0b80f3df7fc43:54729c29e4b0608d4a981990</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>A common question I receive is, "What's the one thing you would tell any breastfeeding mother?" and while there are a lot of things I'd like to tell breastfeeding mothers, there is one thing that I'd like them to learn: Hand Expression.&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe it's my general affinity for a simple, old-fashioned way of doing things, but hand expression is perhaps one of the most useful tools in maximizing milk production and can be used instead of an electric breast pump in an emergency. It can also be useful for expressing milk in the first few days when breasts can be too swollen, and colostrum can be quite thick. An electric pump is sometimes useless in these situations.&nbsp;There are many instances where hand expression works as well, if not much better than electric or manual/hand&nbsp;pumps in expressing milk. Hand expressing is also useful if your electric pump breaks, if you find yourself separated from your baby longer than you had expected (and didn't bring your pump), if you need to be discreet (or at least without the hum of an electric pump),&nbsp;or if you're simply tired of cleaning pump parts. It also stimulates your breast in a way that is more natural than a plastic pump flange&nbsp;and many women find it more productive than a breast pump.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/HandExpression.html">Watch the video here!</a></p><p> </p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
